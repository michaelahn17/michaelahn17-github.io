      freeCodeCamp is the best place to get started if you're interested in learning how to code. They have over hundreds of exercises for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website has in-depth explanations, hands on tutorials, and over thousands of hours in exercises. After completing the tutorials for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I felt as advanced as a professional web designer. Obviously, I do not have the same tools or skills as professionals, but freeCodeCamp prepared me enough to make this entire website from scratch. The website is free to sign up and requires no prior experience. Prior to starting freeCodeCamp, I had never coded anything in my entire life. Thanks to freeCodeCamp, I was able to create my own website.

   w3schools is an absolutely essential resource for coding. Coding has so many different entries that are needed for basic coding. w3schools has an explanation and example for every command for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other languages. They also have thousands of tutorials, references, examples, and exercises to choose from to learn from square one such as I did. I primarily used w3schools when I forgot a simply command, such as how to make words underlined or how to insert an image. w3schools had solutions for every problem that I encountered along the way. w3schools is essentially the ultimate cheatsheet for when you are coding and need help remembering how to do any task.

        CodePen is essentially one of the last steps that are needed to code. CodePen allows you to freely write code in the browser and see your code come to life in real time. CodePen focuses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and has access to all three languages when you are writing your own code. CodePen was extremely convenient because it saves all your work on the cloud, so you can work from multiple devices without ever losing progress. CodePen also publishes different codes from community postings so that people are able to share their work with the entire world. CodePen is a great resource to freely start your own coding experience without having to pay or download anything. I would highly recommend CodePen for anyone that is interested in testing out all the skills they learned from freeCodeCamp.
