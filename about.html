     My name is Michael Ahn and I am a third year student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I am expected to graduate June 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and a certificate in Technical and Professional Communication.
         </p>
         <p>
           I designed and developed this website purely from code for my 2020 Senior Project. Prior to March 2020, I had no prior experience with coding at all. With the help of several coding resources, that are all listed on my website, and my advising professor, Dr. Chelsea Milbourne, I was able to accomplish my goal of creating my own website.
         </p>
         <p>
           After graduation I plan to take a gap year to study for graduate school. At this time I am currently unsure which field I want to focus in, but I am confident that I will be able to figure it as soon as possible.
         </p>
         <p>
           In addition to being a proud Cal Poly graduate, I am an enormous Los Angeles Lakers and Dodgers. I was born and raised in  Los Angeles, CA so my blood bleeds purple, gold, blue and white. Alongside sports, I love listening to music, rock climbing, being with family, and accomplishing all my goals along the way.
         </p>
         <p>
           Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me, and I would love to learn more about you! Please feel free to contact me via email, phone, or connect with me on LinkedIn.
